# Exchange Project
This project was created as part of an IT-academy course to showcase my knowledge of async JavaScript and fetching data from an exchange rate API. You can view the project by clicking on the link provided <a href="https://exchange-yashar.netlify.app/">here</a>.

### Project Overview
The main goal of this project was to demonstrate my ability to fetch data asynchronously from an API and display it dynamically on a web page. The project consists of two dynamic input fields, each with currency code buttons above them. When a user clicks one of these buttons, a request is sent to the API with the required currency codes (base currency and symbol currency). Every time a user types in either input field, a request is sent to the API, and the output is calculated based on the rates received from the API.

The user interface was designed to be similar to the Figma template provided to me. It is static and only for demonstration purposes.

### Features
The Exchange Project includes the following features:

- Input validation to only accept numbers, periods, commas, and backspace keys.
- Automatic conversion of commas to dots for decimal places.
- Automatic insertion of "0." when the user types a period as the first character.
- Limitation of one period per input field.
- Dynamic conversion calculations based on the base input field, every time a user clicks on a currency code button.
- Dynamic conversion calculations based on the input fields every time the user types in either of them.
- Prevention of API requests when the currency codes on both sides are the same.

### Technologies and Features
The Exchange Project was developed using the following technologies and features:

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript
- DOM manipulation
- Asynchronous JavaScript
- Fetch API

Overall, the Exchange Project successfully demonstrates my skills in using modern web development technologies and features to create a functional and user-friendly project. Thank you for taking the time to review this project!
